# teaching tools

Here I share some tools I use in my elementary school classes.  
There are nothing big here, it can be useful or fun though.  

## standing upon the shoulders of giants

The code here works thanks to a lot of work done by others in the *open-source* community. Particularly in
this case I need to mention:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/): the programming language I used.  
- [**p5js**](https://p5js.org/): the javascript version of [**Processing**](https://processing.org).
